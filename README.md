### Inspiration üí°
Medical errors are a critical concern in healthcare, especially after patients leave the hospital. The myPillBox project was born out of the necessity to leverage technology in reducing such errors. Recognizing the challenges faced by both healthcare professionals and patients, we aimed to create a solution that empowers users to manage their medications effectively.

### What it does üöÄ
myPillBox is a comprehensive medication management platform with three key features: Pillbox, Pillvision, and User Profile.

- **Pillbox:** Users can create a free account, add medications from a substantial database, and view a dashboard showcasing medications, their descriptions, and when they should be taken. This empowers patients to understand the purpose of each medication, including warnings such as driving restrictions.

- **Pillvision:** Users can take pictures of their medications, which are processed through a trained model to identify the medication, verify its presence in the user's pillbox, and ensure it's taken at the correct time. This information is logged for future reference, allowing healthcare professionals to assess patient consistency and identify potential errors.

- **User Profile:** Provides minimal information, including name, profile picture, medication history, and accuracy. Accuracy reflects the consistency of timely medication intake, while the history provides insights into specific challenges or patterns.
